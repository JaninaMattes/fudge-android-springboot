<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository documents the design and development of **Fudge Recipe**, including the progression from an early-stage **interactive UX/UI prototype** created in Figma.

To help understand the overall user flow and screen structure, a **click-through Figma prototype** is available. It demonstrates the core navigation and layout of the application and can be explored in the browser.

### 🎨 Interactive Design Prototype

</div>

> **Note:** The prototype is intentionally simple and focuses on user flow and screen transitions rather than final visuals. You can click through the screens directly in your browser.

### Why This README Exists

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, none fully matched the needs of this project. This README was created to be clear, informative, and immediately useful for both contributors and first-time readers.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something meaningful
- You shouldn't repeat the same setup and documentation work for every project
- DRY principles apply to documentation just as much as they do to code

No single template fits every project, so this README will continue to evolve. Suggestions and improvements are always welcome—feel free to fork the repository, open an issue, or submit a pull request.
